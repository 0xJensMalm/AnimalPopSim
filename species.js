/**
 * SPECIES CONFIGURATION FILE
 * -------------------------
 * This file contains all species definitions and their properties that affect simulation behavior.
 * Each parameter directly impacts how species interact within the ecosystem.
 *
 * PARAMETER GUIDE:
 * ===============
 * id:             Unique identifier for the species (required)
 * name:           Display name for the species (required)
 * emoji:          Visual representation in UI (required)
 * color:          Color for graphs and UI elements (required)
 * producer:       Boolean - true for plants, false for animals (required)
 * diet:           Array of species IDs this species eats - empty for producers (required)
 * eatRate:        Probability of successful feeding per tick (0-1) - higher means more successful hunting
 * eatGain:        Energy gained per successful feeding - higher means more energy from each meal
 * breedRate:      Probability of breeding per tick when above threshold (0-1) - higher means faster reproduction
 * deathRate:      Probability of natural death per tick (0-1) - higher means shorter lifespan
 * maxAge:         Maximum number of ticks before guaranteed death - higher means longer potential lifespan
 * maxEnergy:      Maximum energy storage capacity - higher means better survival during food shortages
 * metabolism:     Energy lost per tick (0-1) - higher means faster energy depletion
 * breedThreshold: Minimum energy required to reproduce - higher means more selective breeding
 * photoRate:      PLANTS ONLY - Energy gained from sunlight per tick - higher means faster energy production
 * startPop:       Initial population when simulation begins - higher means more abundant at start
 *
 * ECOSYSTEM BALANCE TIPS:
 * ======================
 * - Increase deathRate or metabolism to control overpopulation
 * - Balance predator eatRate/eatGain with prey breedRate to maintain stable populations
 * - Ensure plants have appropriate photoRate to support the herbivore population
 * - Adjust breedThreshold to make reproduction more or less selective
